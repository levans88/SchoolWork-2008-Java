This is a very simple class assignment emulating a national park reservation system. It was initially completed in 2008 using JDK 1.6.0_16. I have not tested it using any other JDK's but I did test it before uploading it.

To compile:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin
javac file.java

For multiple sources:
javac file1.java file2.java
-or-
javac *.java

To execute:
java -classpath [classpath] file
-OR-
javaw -classpath [classpath] file

Example:
javaw -classpath "F:\Storage\Projects\RestoredSchoolWork\Java\Project6" Driver

Please see Output.pdf for sample output from this program.
